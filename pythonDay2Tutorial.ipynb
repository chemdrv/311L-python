Eventually, we'll be transitioning our scripts to exectuable files, which means that you'll need to be sure to define everything. So, to get started, let's go back to the previous day's work and grab all the import lines. I count four libraries that need to be imported. Go ahead and find all four lines, put them in the cell below, and execute that cell.\n",

    "A note: When we work with functions from these imported libraries, the functions get called like this: `libraryName.functionName()`. That's a method of being careful with namespaces. Just like the Smith family and the Lee family might both have a person named Matt, two different libraries might have a function with the same name. With functions from libraries, the best thing to do is always refer to them as `libraryName.functionName()`. There is a way to import a library so that you just have to type `functionName()`, but it has the same problem as only using first names to identify people in large groups. The more you do this, the more likely you'll get a repeat function name, and then your program can behave in very strange ways.\n",
