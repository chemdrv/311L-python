Numerical information gets stored as other types. Python recognizes integers, called 'int', and numbers with a decimal point, called 'float'.

This means that the first element in an array is numbered 0, and it counts up from there. This is confusing at first, but actually makes a lot of array manipulations easier, once you get used to it. A classic explanation of why many languages use zero indexing is here: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html We can access any element in an array if we know it's index. The syntax looks like this: `dataArray[0]`, which gives me the first element in the dataArray.\n",
