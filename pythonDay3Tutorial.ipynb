The only problem with this version is that it raises an exception and stops at the keyboard interrupt, and we want it to wrap up the acquisition and save the data. To do that, we're gonna write in a `try-except` statement to handle the keyboard interrupt more smoothly.\n",

Since we're not externally grounding our circuit, we want to take the difference between those two points, rather than referencing the output voltage to some external ground. This is a really common circumstance, so the DAQ boards are set up to make that easy. If you use two adjacent analog inputs, the board reads the difference between them.
